## Course Description

This course is an immersive web development bootcamp.  It is a full stack experience using the skills previously developed in languages, API, and framework.  The course pulls it all together in a more difficult and high demanding environment.  Topics include UI considerations, web services, server-side scripting, and database development and use.  Students will complete individual JavaScript projects using the entire web stack.  Groups will complete a real-world, highly complex, JavaScript project using the entire web stack and using separate development environments to promote software through development, QA, and production.  GitHub is used to store the projects.  The course is synchronous with all students participating five nights a week for 9 consecutive weeks. 

Prerequisite: WEB 200, WEB 231, WEB 330, WEB 340, WEB 335, WEB 420, and WEB 425

## Course Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each module.

To get the most out of this course, I encourage everyone to actively participate in Slack by asking questions, answering questions, and helping others out with their application/programming tasks.  Collaboration is not only allowed, it is highly encouraged.
